# 🎓 Software Design and Architecture Specialization🚀  
📚 *University of Alberta – Software Design and Architecture Specialization*

----

👋 Hey there! I'm using this repository to follow along with the **[Software Design and Architecture Specialization]([https://www.coursera.org/specializations/software-design-architecture])** course offered by the **University of Alberta** on Coursera.

🧱 I'm currently working through **Module 1** **Object-Oriented Design**

----

## 📖 Course Description (from Coursera):

> This course takes **Java beginners to the next level** by covering **object-oriented analysis and design**.  
> You'll discover how to create **modular, flexible, and reusable software** by applying object-oriented design principles and guidelines.  
> And you'll learn to communicate your designs visually using **Unified Modeling Language (UML)** 🎨📊

----

## 🧠 What *I* Will Learn (according to Coursera):

- Apply the **Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC)** technique to analyze and design object-oriented models  
- Explain and apply **object-oriented modeling principles** like abstraction, encapsulation, decomposition, and generalization  
- Understand and apply different types of **inheritance** 🧬  
- Explain the differences between **association**, **aggregation**, and **composition**  
- Express object-oriented models as **UML class diagrams**  
- Translate between **UML class diagrams and equivalent Java code** 🔁  
- Apply design guidelines for **modularity**, **separation of concerns**, **information hiding**, and **conceptual integrity**  
- Understand the **tradeoff between cohesion and coupling** 🔧

----

## 🎯 Capstone Challenge:
I'll get to put it all into practice by evolving and documenting a **Java codebase for an Android app**, complete with **UML documentation**! 📱🛠️
